// Generated from Wayland xml protocol: wlr_output_power_management_unstable_v1

/// @file
/// Control power management modes of outputs
///
/// This protocol allows clients to control power management modes
/// of outputs that are currently part of the compositor space. The
/// intent is to allow special clients like desktop shells to power
/// down outputs when the system is idle.
///
/// To modify outputs not currently part of the compositor space see
/// wlr-output-management.
///
/// Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
/// backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
/// may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
/// Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
/// the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
/// Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
/// version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
/// interface version number is reset.
